Recommended Minimum System Requirements
------------


For efficient deployment of the Geoportal, the following bare minimum system requirements need to be satisfied.


• 8GB RAM, (16GB or more preferred for a production deployment)

• 2.2GHz processor with 4 cores. (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)

• 30 GB software disk usage (Reserved to OS and source code only).

• 64 bit architecture is strongly recommended.

NB: 
- Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode, data stored on the DataBase and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
- For db, spatial data, cached tiles, and “scratch space” useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is between 50GB and 100GB but can vary depending on the amount of data one may have.
