Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)
--------------
Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is a set of guidelines regarding the acquisition, storage, visualization, and dissemination of spatial data. The standard definition of SDI is that it is “the technology, policies, standards, human resources, and related activities necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data”. The technology, policies, standards, human resources (sometimes also called stakeholders) and activities work together (as shown in
the image below) to give shape to SDI.

• Policies
Policies include the identification of organizations that will collect spatial data.
Types of data collection (like hydrological, demographic, etc.), who will be the
owner and who will have access to spatial data, and at what level are also part
of policies. Policies also include information regarding updating spatial data.
• Standards
Standards (regarding data) include Coordinate Reference System (CRS) which
will be used to collect spatial data at the source and for distribution, metadata and
types of final outputs that will be distributed.
